CHAPTER 5:

Code development phases: Prep code (pseudocode for logic), Test code (validate accuracy), Real code (actual implementation).
Extreme Programming (XP) rules:
Write test code before real code, push real code when tests pass.
Program in pairs, switching frequently.
Refactor code whenever necessary.
Make small, frequent releases/changes.
Keep code simple.
Prefer for loops over while loops when loop count is known.
Use enhanced for loop to iterate through array elements.
Change primitive data types with type casting (e.g., long to int).
CHAPTER 6:

Java Library (Java API) contains pre-built classes grouped into packages.
ArrayList is a dynamic array with methods for manipulation.
ArrayList can store objects, not primitives (use wrapper classes).
&& and || are short-circuit operators; & and | check both sides.
Utilize online documentation for imported classes.
CHAPTER 7:

Plan programs with future considerations.
Inheritance enables sharing of variables and methods between classes.
Inheritance used when one class is a more specific version of another.
Polymorphism calls the most specific method for an object.
Differentiate IS A (inheritance) vs. HAS A (association) relationships.
Access modifiers control code accessibility (private, default, protected, public).
Inheritance only inherits public members, not private.
Polymorphism allows referencing objects of subclasses.
Inheritance hierarchies are usually wide, not deep.
Subclass methods must follow superclass method signature in overriding.
Overloading differs from overriding (different argument lists).
CHAPTER 8:

Abstract classes prevent instantiation and serve as templates.
Interfaces define contracts for class behaviors and can be applied to unrelated classes.
Abstract methods in abstract classes must be overridden (no code body).
All classes extend the Object class in Java.
Object class provides polymorphic methods (e.g., toString).
Casting can convert Object references back to the original class.
Multiple inheritance can be achieved through interfaces.
Choose class, subclass, abstract class, or interface based on design needs.
CHAPTER 9:

Recap of instance variables, constructors, and their role in object creation.
Constructors initialize object state and must match class name.
Default constructor is provided if none is defined (parameterless).
Overloaded constructors have different argument lists.
Instance variables have default values if not explicitly initialized.
